            <p>Utiel Requena is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) for wines located in the province of
                Valencia (Valencian Community). It takes its name from the two neighbouring towns of Utiel and Requena.
                It is renowned for the predominant use of the Bobal grape variety.</p>
            <p>Grape growing is Utiel-Requena's driving economic force, and archaeological finds show viticulture
                dates back to at least the 7th Century BC, from the time of the early Iberians. In 1BC, Ancient
                Romans settled there and introduced improved winemaking techniques.</p>

            <p>The region has enjoyed fame and demand during various periods since, particularly during the late
                19th Century. Then outbreaks of phylloxera and powdery mildew devastated production in France.
                Utiel-Requena's wines helped to fill the void.</p>

            <p>Utiel-Requena was established as a DO in 1957. The towns of Utiel and Requena lie to the northwest
                and southeast of the designation respectively.</p>
            <h3>Grapes</h3>
            <p>The Bobal grape variety occupies over 80% of the vineyards.[1] Bobal is the second most planted red grape
                variety in Spain.[3] Planting density is between 1,600 vines/ha and the maximum of 4,000 vines/ha.

                The authorized grape varieties are:</p>

        <article>
            <p>Ribera del Duero is a Spanish Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP) located in the country's northern
                plateau
                and is one of eleven </p>

            <p>The region is characterised by a largely flat, rocky terrain and is centred on the town of Aranda de
                Duero,
                although the most famous vineyards surround Peñafiel and Roa de Duero to the west, where the regional
                regulatory
                council or Consejo Regulador for the denominación is based.

                <p>Ribera del Duero wines are currently enjoying greater popularity, thanks largely to the considerable
                    interest
                    shown in the area by experienced growers from other regions.</p>
                <h3>Grapes</h3>
                <p>Wines produced in the Ribera del Duero DO derive almost exclusively from red grapes. The vast
                    majority of
                    production is dedicated to Tinto Fino (the local name for Tempranillo[a]), the dominant red varietal
                    in
                    the
                    northern half of the Spanish peninsula. Tinto Fino is often, but not always, complemented with
                    Cabernet
                    Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot, although the famous Tinto Pesquera, grown by Alejandro Fernández in
                    Pesquera
                    de Duero, is a 100% Tempranillo varietal wine. The introduction of Pesquera's 100% Tinto Fino wine
                    was,
                    at
                    the time, somewhat controversial, as the considered benchmark Vega Sicilia wines traditionally
                    blended
                    Tinto
                    Fino with such Bordeaux varietals as Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.</p>

            <p>Rioja [ˈrjoxa] is a wine region in Spain, with denominación de origen calificada (D.O.Ca., "Qualified
                Designation of Origin," the highest category in Spanish wine regulation). Rioja wine is made from grapes
                grown in the autonomous communities of La Rioja and Navarre, and the Basque province of Álava. Rioja is
                further subdivided into three zones: Rioja Alta, Rioja Oriental and Rioja Alavesa. Many wines have
                traditionally blended fruit from all three regions, though there is a slow growth in single-zone wines.

            <h3>Grapes</h3>
            <p>The traditional varieties authorized by the Regulating Council of the D.O.Ca. Rioja since its foundation
                in
                1925 have been seven, four red and three white:

            <p>In 2007, the Regulating Council of the D.O.Ca. Rioja authorized, for the first time since 1925, the
                incorporation of some additional varieties within the limits of the denomination, changes that were
                reflected in two modifications of the existing Regulation approved in 2004: BOE-A-2008-4991 and BOE
                -A-2009-8950, but this has been subject to subsequent amendment.[6]

            <p>The Priorat DOCa / DOQ was formed as a DO in 1932, and promoted to DOCa in 2009. Along with Rioja, is one
                of
                the only Spanish appellations to achieve this highest Spanish wine category of DOCa, called DOQ in
                Catalan.
                The international market accounts for 52% of the Priorat’s wine sales.</p>
            <p>The Priorat DOCa wine region’s roots go back to the pre-Roman period, demonstrated by the Iberian Iron
                Age
                hilltop villages in the area that saw the introduction of wine culture to the region almost 3,000 years
                ago.
                In the Roman period, the Roman capital of Hispania (effectively half of Spain) was Tarragona, a day’s
                walk
                from the Priorat. Therefore, it seems likely that the Priorat helped supply the Roman capital with wine.
                In
                the medieval period that greatest landlord, and consequently the largest wine maker, was the Carthusian
                Monastery of Escaladei founded in the 12th century, from which the region gets the name of Priorat
                (“Priory”).</p>

                <p>In 2008, 4,796 tonnes (5,287 tons) of grapes were harvested, of which 4,580 tonnes (5,050 tons) (96%)
                was
                red grapes and 198.5 tonnes (218.8 tons) (4%) white grapes.[7] This resulted in 27,698 hectolitres
                (609,300
                imp gal; 731,700 US gal) of wine. During the recent expansion of Priorat vineyards, production of red
                grapes
                has expanded, while the production of white grapes has even declined somewhat. Thus, the proportion of
                white
                grapes has dropped from 10% in 2001 to 4% in 2008, while the total production increased by 92% over the
                same
                period.[7]
            </p>

            The yield in 2008 corresponds to 2,700 kg of grapes per hectare compared to the official maximum of 6,000
            kg
            per hectare, and corresponds to 16 hectoliter per hectare. The official maximum corresponds to a yield of 39
            hectoliter per hectare, as a 65% conversion (0.65 litre of wine per kilogram of grapes) is foreseen. Some
            producers have yields of only around 5 hectoliter per hectare
            <h3>Grapes</h3>
            <p>The traditional grape variety grown in El Priorat is the red Garnacha tinta, which is found in all the
                older
                vineyards. </p>
            <code>
                <ul>
                    <li class="main-list">Also authorized are the following red varieties: Garnacha Peluda, Cariñena (or
                        Samsó), Cabernet
                        Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. </li>
                    <li class="main-list"> Four white varieties are also authorized: Garnacha blanca,

            </code>


            <p>The trend among the red varieties is that Garnacha stays constant, Cariñena decreases and the
                international
                grape varieties increase. While Cabernet Sauvignon has always been in the lead among these, in recent
                years,
                Syrah has increased faster.</p>
